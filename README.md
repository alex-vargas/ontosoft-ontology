OntoSoft Ontology

OntoSoft project URL: http://ontosoft.org/

Ontology created to provide a vocabulary for scientist to describe their software in order for it to be accessible to other users, allow others to run it, cite it, understand it, and use it in their experiments.

Ontosoft is organized in two different modules. The first one is the ontology for describing software. The second one is a classification of the properties for their annotation.
