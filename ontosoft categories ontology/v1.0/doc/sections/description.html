<h2>3. OntoSoftCategories Description <span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h2>
<p><p>The metadata captured by the OntoSoftCategories ontology falls into six major categories based on information that a scientist would seek about the software: 1) identify software, 2) understand and assess software, 3) execute software, 4) get support for the software, 5) do research with the software, and 6) update the software. The rationale for this organization is to allow the users who contribute software to understand why the metadata is requested, and to allow the users that are looking to reuse the software where to find metadata that is relevant to them.
